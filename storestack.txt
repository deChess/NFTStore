Mol LeArt is a versatile DAO NFT Platform which features Fractional Ownership, Royalties, Social Coins, Collaborator Splits, Transaction Fees and a MultiSig Wallet.

Moralis
Serverless Dapp Service

The NFT Store takes advantage of nearly all the features offered by the Mol LeArt contracts. We'll have the option to collect transaction fees on NFT purchases. When it's time to spend those fees we'll use the multisig to enforce our agreement on chain as to where the funds are going and how much.

The Admin page gives us the ability to alter transaction fees, whitelist creators and withdraw funds.

The Profile page is where the minters can edit their avatar pic and social media links.

Moralis is used in place of a regular database and offers up a lot of on chain data options for us.








That's my info do whatever you want with it. The one thing I'm really keen for is the info about Mol LeArt being in there somewhere.
They have an actual but small community, I'll be keen to report about this project to them, I've told them I'm working on it. But anyway there's a bit of instant community for us if we want.
